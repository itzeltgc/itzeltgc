# Hi there 👋 I'm Itzelt 

### ✨ Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👩🏻‍💻  
I’m a data science student driven by the challenge of turning complex problems into actionable insights. 
I’m passionate about applying technology to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and create meaningful, measurable impact.

Throughout my academic and project experience, I’ve worked on solving real-world problems using tools like machine learning, time series forecasting, probabilistic modeling (e.g., Markov chains, Bayesian networks), and geospatial analytics. 
Whether it’s segmenting customers for smarter financial strategies, identifying risk through predictive models, or analyzing economic sectors for policy recommendations, I thrive on using data to make a difference.
